# HeroCraft
HeroCraft is a small console application that lets you create heroes and do battle with them. 
You can either input commands directly into the console yourself, 
input the "Demonstrate" command to see the result of a set of predetermined commands, 
or input the "Randomize" command, which generates a series of random hero interactions.
